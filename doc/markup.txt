[heading Basics]

Texts inserted into the [link https://ubeer.org naga CMS] can be easily formatted using a dedicated markup language.
Handling this markup is actually quite simple and inherits a lot from the well-known [i Wikipedia] markup language.

Easy things are often understood best by looking at some example:[br]
[c This is a .[b simple.] example on how to use the .[link https://ubeer.org .[i naga markup language.] .]. ]
[br]
will be rendered as 
[br]
This is a [b simple] example on how to use the [link https://ubeer.org [i naga markup language] ]
[br]
[br]
You will notice that this example basically is plain text intermingled with some .[ and .].
Writing naga markup is basically exactly that - writing plain text unless you want to have the text behave special.
Special in this case means you want some words to appear [b bold], as headings etc.
This special behaviour can be achived by intermingling markup calls.
All markup calls are build the same way:
they are included in between a [c .[] and [c .] ]. The fist word is tells what should be done and everything else are the arguments.
For writing bold text, for instance just type 
[br]
[c .[b bold text.] ]
[br]
The [c b] tells that everything up until the closing [c .] ] should be printed bold, [c bold text] being the text to be printed bold.
That is quite fine, but what if you actually want a [c .[] to appear within the text [i as is]?
In this case, just [i escape] the braket by doubling it, thus in order to get a [c .[ ] write
[br]
[c ...[ ]
[br]
in order to get a [c .] ] type:
[br]
[c ..] ]

[heading markup tags]

Currently, there are the following markup tags supported:

[ulist [code heading] Creates a heading * [code b] bold text * [code i] italic text * [code code] For code chunks * [code list] for creating ordered lists * [code ulist] for creating unordered lists * [code link] for creating links]

[heading [code list] / [code ulist] ]

The format of list is 
[br]
[code .[list ENTRY ONE * ENTRY TWO * ENTRY THREE ... .] ]
[br]

[heading link]

The format of link is 
[br]
[code .[link LINK_TARGET LINK TEXT]
[br]

LINK TEXT can be omitted, then LINK_TARGET is used as link text.
If LINK_TARGET matches [code PROTOCOL://SOMETHING], it is assumed to link to an external resource, otherwise the LINK_TARGET is interpreted to link to an article on the web page, and a link to an article with this key is generated.
