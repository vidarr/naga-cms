<h1>The aims of developing fuLisp</h1>

Why trying hard to develop yet a new programming language interpreter?
It would certainly make sense to undertake this quest if you felt that all the
existing languages lack features you desperately desire or if there is this
SINGLE language you really adore but unfortunately, no interpreter / compiler is
available to you.
It could also well be, that there are technical reasons that make it desireable
to come up with an own implementation, performance issues being one good reason
amidst others.
None of these reasons holds for fuLisp.
The language fuLisp implements is not new, it is 
<a href="htps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP">LISP</a>, kind of a new flavour,
but nevertheless, LISP.
There are a bunch of <a href="aims.html#Lisp Compilers/Interpreters">compilers /
interpreters</a> and <a href="Developing Tools">developing tools</a> around, mostly
Open Source and with an abundand set of features.
Until now, it did quite a bit of programming in different languages, had short
glimpses on a dozen more languages, including "weird" ones like <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forth">Forth</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> and
"established" ones ranging from (Q)Basic and Turbo Pascal over C, C++, Fortran (95),
Java to Perl.
in my humble opinion, there is only Java that can compare with Lisp when it
comes down to the availability of software tools that support you developing.
